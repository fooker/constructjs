General Information
===================

construct.js is a JSON prototyping system for coffeescript/javascript. It allows
to generate arbitrary JSON structures from a templat.

construct.js allows to intermix JSON structures with logical elements using
functions. If the template is evaluated, all functions contained in the template
are called and the function is replaced by its return value.

Additionaly construct.js provides a set of usefull helper functions which can be
used in the templates.



Installation
============

Include the file js/construct.js in your application.



Usage
=====

You can use the cs command to create a construct.js template. The structure
passed to the cs command is used as the template:

 tpl = cs {
   'foo' : 42
   'bar' : () -> 23
 }

The template can be transaformed into a real structure by calling the cs object:

 tpl = cs {
   'bar' : () -> 23
 }

 result = tpl()
 # result now contains the evaluated structure: { 'bar' : 23 }

The helper functions allows to put some logic into the template:

 tpl = cs {
   'bar' : cs.if (() -> true), {
     'foo' : 23
   }, {
     'bar' : 42
   }

 result = tpl()
# result now contains the evaluated structure: { 'foo' : 23 }
